 thumbs-up book reviews

## summary
an app to improve reviewing by making it easier to get started. Go for a basic thumbs-up or thumbs-down on the whole book, or rate individual aspects independently. Loved the prose? Rate it so! Didn't like the ending? Down goes the thumb. If no-one else has rated something you want to point out, you can add it to the list of rateable points.

You can also tag points which may be useful to people considering the book - perspective, tense, dialect, formality, genre, subgenre, and more!
