# general notes
a potential way to run it together
https://dev.to/loujaybee/using-create-react-app-with-express

goodreads api
https://www.goodreads.com/api/index#owned_books.list

google books api
https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/reference/bookshelves

I assume I want to deploy to heroku, if only because I have no idea how to get it working on krystal

MongoDB - don't forget to make sure it's on the kvm address

Will need a lot more stuff
* cookie policy and banner (cookiebot will work but I'd really rather not)
* oauth stuff
* a way to upload images (use the same as the tutorial project)
* a button to import from goodreads
